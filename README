What is libDDD ?

libDDD is a C++ library for manipulation of decision diagrams.

Main features include:

* Flexible and powerful encoding of operations using inductive homomorphisms
* Support for hierarchy of the description with SDD
* Automatic support for saturation style algorithms
* A priori unbounded integer domain variables
* Rich expressivity with equiv-split mechanism
* Weak ordering constraint allowing to store variable length decision paths
* Supports both Data Decision Diagrams which are integer valued and Hierarchical Set Decision Diagrams.

libDDD is distributed under the terms of LGPL.
